Bootstrap aggregation, also known as bagging, is a machine learning ensemble technique that involves training multiple models on different subsets of the training data and then combining their predictions to improve overall performance.
Steps Involved :
Fare_amount is the target column

step 1 - Load the dataset

step 2 getting the shape of the dataset

step 3 - getting the information about the dataset

step 4 - getting the statistical data of the dataset

step 5 - getting the datatype in the dataset

step 6 - finding the missing data

step 7 - plotting the distribution to visualize the outliers

step 8 - now we will see if there are outliers in the data

step 9 - identifying the outliers

step 10 - removing the outliers

step 11 - Feature engineering

step 12 - finding the unique values in the dataset where we have the category of input plotting the distribution of boxplot.

step 13- pd.cut() function is used here to create new columns 'Monthly_Quarter' and 'Hourly_Segments'.

step 14 - We will only keep the observation where fare is more than O USD

step 15- Plot the countplot for weekends

step 16 -Data split for testing and training

step 17 - Accuracy prediction using ensembling algorithm

By applying bootstrap aggregation to the Uber dataset columns, you can enhance the robustness and accuracy of your machine learning models, leading to more reliable predictions and insights for various analytical tasks.
